# My FIBS algo challenges

My solutions to the "algo challenges" at work. Take them with a grain of salt.

## Languages

Even though I am a Java developer, here I prototype my algorithms usually in Ruby, because I find that less verbose yet more readable. Once ready, I also like to implement everything again in Rust, because I would like to learn Rust better, and because I like how sometimes it forces me to consider all the cases, making my algorithms more robust.

## Development

These are not full fedged programs, the Ruby scripts are often just a `main.rb` file, and the Rust programs are just a very minimal binary. (Most of them don't even have tests ðŸ«£) But as they are developed in Visual Studio Code, each solution has its own devcontainer, therefore you should be able to run them locally without problems if you want.
