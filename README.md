# FIBS Hungary algo challenges

My solutions to the "algo challenges" at work. Take them with a grain of salt.

## Languages

Even though I am a Java developer, here I prototype my algorithms usually in Ruby, because I find that less verbose yet more readable. Once ready I also like to implement everything again in Rust, because I would like to learn Rust better, and because I like how sometimes it forces me to consider all the cases, making my algorithms more robust.
